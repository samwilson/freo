A poem written by Basil Garrity in 1979. Basil was born in York on 6 June 1926 and moved to James Street, Fremantle, in 1929.

He was quoted in [[Wharf Rats and other stories]] (Fremantle Primary School P&C Association, 2004):
"One of my greatest pleasures was when old fellows would call me up after reading my poem,
so sentimental that they would shed a few tears.
All I ever wanted was for the poem to preserve Fremantle's history. It was quite a place, you know."

## Fremantle Town

*By Basil Garrity.*

I'm a native of Fremantle and I have been all my life<br>
And like a lot of other folks, I've had my share of strife<br>
But what a place to have it, for it's sure been worth the fun<br>
To grow up in good old Freo, near the sea and 'neath the sun. 

I remember all the good times when the place was pretty small<br>
And the folks were poor but simple, but were proud and they stood tall.<br>
For they'd lived through a depression and with strength had passed the test<br>
The men and women of Fremantle were equal to the best.

The trams, they ran in those days, it was transport at its best<br>
You could travel north and south and east but never to the west.<br>
And everybody used them if they didn't have to walk<br>
You were sure to meet a friend and enjoy a bit of talk.

On Sunday, in the summer when the days were very hot <br>
A penny transfer ticket would take you to a spot <br>
Where the day would be a corker, you could run or fish or swim <br>
And if you had another penny a prize you just might win. 

For out South in the thirties, there were lots of things to do <br>
The place was always crowded and you rarely saw a blue. <br>
There was Hoop-las, Hittem Knockems, games for young and old <br> 
And for just another penny you could have your fortune told. 

The swimming it was bonzer when the days were hot and warm <br>
And the kids took full advantage while the folks yarned upon the lawn. <br>
Then tired, burnt and cranky, you would board the trams with moans <br>
And another transfer ticket would take you to your home. 

And to go into Fremantle for a ride and kill some time <br>
Was sure worth another penny for the fun that you would find. <br>
You could stand upon the corner down at High and Market Street <br>
And be sure to see Black Paddy coming in his bare feet. 

A stockman at Robbs Jetty, he was known by everyone <br>
And everybody liked him, he was just so full of fun. <br>
He was always neat and tidy with a smile upon his face <br>
It was really good to know him, a credit to his race. 

And remember Sandshoe Willy, silly grin upon his face <br>
He would scoot around old Freo at a most amazing pace. <br>
He would glide along the pavement with his eyes upon the ground <br>
Then you'd see him stoop and rise again and quickly look around. 

For he'd just picked up a bumper, or if you prefer a butt <br>
And if you continued watching, you'd see him light it up. <br>
Then his eyes would grow all starry and he'd start his silly grin <br>
He was happy in the knowledge that he'd had another win. 

There was also Percy Buttons, he would sometimes come to town <br>
And for just two bob this character would act just like a clown <br>
He would throw back flips and somersaults and other types of tricks <br>
You would just as likely see him any night outside the flicks. 

With his hat upon the pavement upside down to catch the trays <br>
He would entertain the people in a dozen different ways. <br>
I used to gaze in wonder as he threw himself around <br>
For he had a mighty hernia that nearly reached the ground. 

And there was Two Bob Andy in his battered tattered coat <br>
A scary looking joker and considered quite a joke. <br>
You would find him at the Derbies standing in among the mob <br>
And to ask him who will win tolSay was always "<del>South</del><ins>East</ins> two bob".

Another old well known local, with strong Fremantle ties <br>
Was a chap that lived near the Plympton and was known as Jimmy Four Eyes. <br>
With his cart he would walk round the district his way to make a few bob <br>
He would sharpen your knives and scissors, yes that was old Jimmy's job. 

There was also another fellow who seemed out of place in our town <br>
He was always dressed quite fancy and a good bloke to be around. <br>
An expert on the piano, Joe Ward was known by all <br>
He delighted the people of Free, in their homes, a pub or a hall. 

A remittance man from the Old Dart, was the story I was told <br>
He lived in a shed in North Freo, that in winter sure would have been cold. <br>
But the cold it did not deter him in fact he paid it no heed <br>
No rugs or blankets did Joe have, but layers of dry seaweed. 

The kids of the town all knew him, they really liked him a lot <br>
And on meeting, the first thing they asked him was "Please sing us Dickory Dock". <br>
But he scored a hit with us youngsters, this man in the fancy dats <br>
For he always made sure when he met you, that he had a bag full of black cats. 

And near the Freo Station was a bloke that had no peer <br>
His name was Tinny Thomas, famous for his ginger beer. <br>
He sold it from a fancy cart with openings at the side <br>
Rather like the type in which the gypsies used to ride. 

And across the road from Tinnys was a place we all knew well <br>
A taxi rank that ran for years and known as Marion Bells. <br>
I used to often wonder who had money for such trips <br>
But then I found the answer, wealthy tourists from the ships. 

While up the road a little, another fellow could be found <br>
A real important bloke was he, the Mayor of Freo Town. <br>
Frank Gibson was his name, though later he became Sir Frank <br>
'Twas chaps like him who shaped the place and whom we ought to thank. 

And across the road from Gibsons, we could spend time at the flicks <br>
A large imposing building that was built of solid bricks. <br>
So when in town you walk along the Mall, look up and see <br>
The original face of the Majestic and the letters in steel, MT. 

In later years, when the theatre was finished and closed its doors <br>
it became well known and popular as a Coles Department Store. <br>
We had lost a place of enjoyment, where we used to watch the flicks <br>
But we gained a fancy place to shop, with nothing over two and six. 

There was also the Princess Theatre along in Market Street <br>
And the Saturday morning kids show was always a pretty good treat. <br>
Still being used to this very day, but I find it hard to bear <br>
That this place we loved and enjoyed so much is now used for car repairs. 

And down the road a couple of blocks was a place known as Ugly Land <br>
But I never did get behind the fence to learn of its joys first hand. <br>
I'm told there was boxing and wrestling, concerts and plays and things <br>
So maybe some old codger with some info, may find time to give me a ring. 

When today I walk through the markets, I remember how it used to be <br>
Horses and carts lined up with their produce, the smell of vegies, fruit and horses' pee. <br>
But its good to see it still standing and not smashed and torn to the ground <br>
For the people flock there in their thousands to buy or to look around. 

How many remember the old days and the horses that pulled the large drays <br>
From the wharf to the large brick storehouses of which many are standing today. <br>
Yes those beautiful large strong Clydesdales clip clopping along the street <br>
Such a vision of strength and beauty in the rain, the wind and the heat. 

It brings to my mind as I'm dreaming, of a spot where they stopped for a drink <br>
So come on you old Freo people, you'll remember if you just think. <br>
Well you know where His Majesty's Pub is on the corner of Phillimore Street <br>
There were horse troughs in the middle of the roadway and a place where the drivers could meet. 

Yes there's one still left in our city that's been saved I'm glad to say <br>
That reminds us of what we grew up with and don't see a lot of today. <br>
Yes the horse trough restored to such beauty, down the bottom of Market Street <br>
Gives an old Freo bloke such fond memories and also a memorable treat. 

But I mustn't forget old North Freo, for it brings back old memories to me <br>
For how many remember the Tar Pots and just where they used to be. <br>
Well the train bridge way back in the thirties was West of where it sits today <br>
And between the bridge and the North Wharf that's where they used to lay. 

I remember the Chinese Gardens over North on the river's edge <br>
The old Chinese codgers that worked them with their yokes and large hats on their heads. <br>
With their trousers rolled up to their knee caps, from their buckets, they'd water the rows <br>
Or you'd see them preparing a section, and all they would use would be hoes. 

Remember sometimes in the winter when the river, boy she used to rise <br>
Well, I'd go over North for a tram ride and couldn't believe my own eyes <br>
For the garden the Chinese had tended and nurtured with such loving care <br>
Was completely covered by water, yes the garden was no longer there. 

But this setback, it did not deter them, these hard working men from the north <br>
For as soon as the water receded, they would then set about to bring forth. <br>
A garden again in its glory and in no time again you would see <br>
The sprouts of the vegies appearing where the flood waters used to be.

And next to the garden in those days, was a factory we all knew so well <br>
It was known as the Pearces Boot Factory and, boy, remember the smell <br>
Of the hides they prepared in the tin sheds and hung on the racks to dry <br>
Before making the boots anoVthe sandals for us Freo people to buy. 

But Christmas Eve in Freo, in the days of long ago <br>
Was an evening to remember, all the family used to go. <br>
For final Christmas shopping or to meet a friend in town <br>
Or just to mingle with the mob and have a walk around. 

The pavements were all crowded with the iaughing happy throng <br>
While from the front bar of the National someone would give voice to song. <br>
And before the night was over, one thing you did for sure <br>
Was to make your way to William Street about near Wrightson's door. 

There standing in the roadway, painted white and neat and clean <br>
Was a lovely hawker's barrow, the best you'd ever seen <br>
Cooked prawns was all he sold you know, at fourpence a large pot <br>
And over in old St Johns Square they really hit the spot. 

While along from Wrightsons, next to Swanseas was a shop <br>
And every time I went to town, in front of it I'd stop. <br>
For in those days, the items that were hanging on the walls <br>
I'd only seen on Grand-dad's farm in all the horses' stalls. 

For the shop was full of harnesses, saddles and bridles too <br>
Not the usual type I'd seen though, but bright and shiny new. <br>
The scent of new worked leather was always heavy in the air <br>
I guess that's why I always stopped outside to stand and stare. 

And remember round South Terrace, there was quite a vegie shop <br>
Run by another Freo bloke and known as just Chin Hop. <br>
It's the memory of the likes of him that makes Freo such a place <br>
Yes, full of decent people of every colour, creed and race. 

I remember, with my brother going fishing down the quay <br>
We would usually make a day of it, my brother, mates and me. <br>
And when we tired of fishing, there were other things you know <br>
You could sit and watch the ships come in and even see 'em go. 

And when we'd finished fishing, we'd walk the railway track <br>
Our fishing bags, my mates and I and my big brother Jack. <br>
And round about Dalgety's were great stacks of sandalwood <br>
The scent that drifted up from them was really something good. 

While further round the river, as for home we made our way <br>
We'd likely stop at Gourley's place to swim or just to play. <br>
And if you saw old Robin at the gate or down the lane <br>
You'd just as likely get from him, a stick of sugar cane. 

But did you ever spend a Sunday down old Point Walter way <br>
For if you did, you must agree, It was really quite a day. <br>
You could catch a little billy-cart tram outside the Leopold Pub <br>
And sit and wait for the ride to start with your bathers and your grub. 

And what a corker ride it was when the trammie let her fly <br>
As you tried to catch the bushes as they went racing by. <br>
The place was always crowded, groups were spread out all around <br>
The people came by car and boat to this beaut picnic ground. 

And when you'd finished swimming and running round the beach <br>
You'd scoot along the foreshore to a place called Blackwall Reach <br>
Where all the kids were pirates, climbing round and acting brave <br>
And if someone had a candle, you could then explore a cave. 

And when the sun began to set, the crabbing would begin <br>
While in the dark the fires .would glow beneath the kero tin. <br>
The night would be full of laughter and singing on the beach <br>
And the knowledge of such a tasty treat brought us scurrying back from the reach. 

About this time the dads returned, wash tubs filled to the brim <br>
And everyone would gather around while they threw the blueys in. <br>
But what a way to end your day, eating crabs down at the spit <br>
While all agreed when they'd had their feed the day had been a hit. 

I wish I could remember more of long forgotten days <br>
And how we used to spend our time in long forgotten ways. <br>
There was no need to tear about in fancy cars and things <br>
'Cos life was slow when you had no dough, but you had what mateship brings. 

You remember the Emerald, the Zephyr, the Vai boats when they used to run <br>
And take us on boat trips and picnics and places where life was fun. <br>
It may not seem much to the new chum or visitors to our old town <br>
But to old Freo folks with long memories, they'd remember if they're still around. 

It's nice to remember how things were in the good old yesteryear <br>
And I often sit and think and dream and it almost brings a tear. <br>
But in years to come when I'm growing old, and the new ways get me down <br>
I can still reflect and be proud to know, I grew up in Freo town.
