**Barnett Street** is a residential street in the east end of Fremantle
that runs from Quarry Street to a dead-end that opens to Fremantle Park.
The street used to run around the corner and join to [[Shuffrey Street]] but that part of it is now included in the park.
It was named after Henry Calvert Barnett,
the Superintendent of the [Lunatic Asylum](../buildings/Finnerty_Street/1_Finnerty_Street.html)
and Government Health Officer at the port for the last couple of decades of the 19th century.[^WesternMail]

There may have been another Barnett Street, in East Fremantle, c.1897.[^West1897]

On 27 December 1940, Ralph Menzel of Barnett Street was killed in a road accident on Canning Highway.[^FremantleFatality]
