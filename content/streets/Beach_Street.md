Beach Street runs along the railway line between the east end and the port.
Most people probably couldn't pinpoint where [[Beach Street]], [[Elder Place]], and [[Phillimore Street]] begin and end,
because they continue from one another.
Beach Street starts at [[Edward Street]] (which itself is often mistaken for [[Parry Street]],
at the corner near [[Captain Munchies]] and the [[Australia Tavern]].
It continues north-east until it becomes [[Riverside Road]] at the point it passes under the [[Old Traffic Bridge]].
