**Croke Lane** is a small street in the [[West End]] that runs off [[Cliff Street]] and connects to the parking area of [[Little High Street]].
It was initially called Dalgety Street, after the [[Dalgety and Co.]] warehouse that was located there,
but was renamed to Croke Lane to reduce confusion (Dalgety had warehouses in multiple locations around Fremantle).
The new name was in honour of Lieutenant Captain [[James L. Croke]], harbour master of Fremantle harbour in 1868.<ref>[[City of Fremantle and Town of East Fremantle Street Names Index]]</ref>

The two main buildings on the street are the [[Shipwreck Galleries]] on the southern side, and the offices of the [[Fremantle Herald]] on the north.
